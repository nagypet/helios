## Presentation

This software executes as a linux demon for controlling the wrong bypass
behaviour of the Helios KWL EC370WR ventilation system. The firmware of
the Helios device is 2.24. The problem is that in summer operation the room
could be cooled at night by the cooler outdoor air by opening the bypass
valve, but in the firmware 2.24 it does not work correctly, the bypass
never opens. This little software reads the temperature values via modbus/tcp
and opens the bypass valve if the needed conditions meet.

My software is based on mbpoll (https://github.com/epsilonrt/mbpoll).

mbpoll is a command line utility to communicate with ModBus slave (RTU or TCP).  
It uses [libmodbus](http://libmodbus.org/).  
This is a multiplatform project, the compilation was tested on GNU Linux
x86 and x86_64, Microsoft Windows 7 x86 and GNU Linux ARM 6 (Raspbian).  
Although the syntax of these options is very close modpoll proconX program,
it is a completely independent project.

mbpoll can:

- read discrete inputs
- read and write binary outputs (*coil*)
- read input registers
- read and write output registers (*holding register*)

The reading and writing registers may be in decimal, hexadecimal or 
floating single precision.

## Installation

* Install dependencies:

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake qt4-dev-tools build-essential

* Check the version of qmake (must be 2.X) :

        qmake -v
          QMake version 2.01a
          Using Qt version 4.8.6 in /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf

  If the version is 3.X is that you have QT5, you must select QT4:

        qtchooser -l
          4
          5
          default
          qt4-arm-linux-gnueabihf
          qt4
          qt5-arm-linux-gnueabihf
          qt5
        qtchooser -print-env
          QT_SELECT="default"
          QTTOOLDIR="/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/qt5/bin"
          QTLIBDIR="/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf"
        export QT_SELECT="qt4"
        qmake -v
          QMake version 2.01a
          Using Qt version 4.8.6 in /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf

* Build and install helios :

        cd helios
        qmake
        make
        sudo make install
	sudo cp ./start_helios.sh /etc/init.d
	sudo cp ./restart_helios /etc/cron.hourly
	update-rc.d start_helios.sh defaults

* Starting the demon manually (otherwise it starts at system boot)
        /etc/init.d/start_helios.sh start

log files are creted in /var/packages/helios. If a problem occures at starting
the demon please manually create the log directory.

That's all !
